# The Directors

Yeah. Us.

This is personal, so I'll write in first person. I'm Heman and I directed with Qasim.

Hopefully future directors will get rid of our names as needed.

Below is a small summary of [what we do](#what-we-do) and then some tips based on [what we learned.](#lessons-we-learned)

It's hard to want to write this, because if I'm choosing you to direct R&D,
I expect you to know a lot of this or be able to form your own (likely superior)
understanding.

# What we do

There's a lot of different approaches to describing what we do. First, I'll describe
the [people](#people). Then, I'll describe the [timings](#times). These two would help you understand the [meetings](#meetings)
I'll describe third.  Finally, there'll be some [miscellaneous
notes and things we have done](#other-stuff-we-do) and recommend that you do.

## People

So below the directors is the entire R&D team. Above, there are the executive directors.
Across, there are fellow directors. Everybody should be friends, but that is what the
ranking looks like.

Note that I don't mention alumni and users. I expect you to know how to deal
with them from having been a project lead. For a refresher on that,
read the doc. Knowing who's a right alumnus should be easy from that.

### Project Leads

You basically need to help these people. But also, you need to trust them.

Project leads tend to have a good idea about their projects and how to run it.
So let them run it.

The key trick to being able to trust your project leads is to pick project leads you trust.
So you have to know the architects. You have to know people. Then, just look at their work
and how they interact with the rest of the team. Some helpful questions might be:
- How did they face a hardship?
- How much have they contributed to R&D?
- How busy are they or will they be?
- How have they interacted with a beginner?

You, as their director, should be able to answer this question. And you should like the
answer you think of for them.

If you have that, you have the best team of project leads you can have. You will be able to
trust them and you will know that you can push them forward.

Because, they really should be independent.

If these people are right, the architects should naturally follow.

### Architects

You should definitely know your architects. But remember that they work on their project
first and foremost.

They also are likely beginners and don't know that much about HackRU. So help them: you're
the experienced representative, R&D co-director!

Recall that architects are not allowed to submit hacks for a prize at HackRU.

### Other Organizers

Basically, treat organizers as you would the relevant director, except that organizers do not
know everything directors do. So respect them, help them if you can, but remember that they
may not know much about HackRU's general structure.

Also, every team is different, so do not expect the organizers to act the same way as architects
or project leads. Food, for instance, has more or less on organizers. However, finance, might
be as big as R&D.

### Other Directors

The biggest difficulty with other directors is just how little they know about R&D. This should
not be a surprise: they have their own work. But more often than not, they have not been involved
with R&D and don't quite know all the tech.

Otherwise, they're really awesome.

They will suggest projects and keep poking R&D, but you can say no if R&D isn't ready for their
project.

Here are some specifics from R&D's perspective on the other teams. (Basically, how, as R&D, you
might interact with the other team.)

#### Executives

These directors have been directors for a year or so and lead the directing team.

They are very helpful with tracking deadlines and facilitating inter-team communication.

#### MnD

They stole our naming convention.

They give us assets for the web page and define the colors for us to use.

We give the marketing team email lists occassionally, for registered users, or users who are coming.
We maintain the mailing list while the splash page is up.

#### Finance

We ask this team for some quick stuff.

They should read the sponsorship site and approve it.

Also, they provide logos that need to be put on the main site. Remember that nobody at HackRU can
tweak the logos without permission from the sponsors.

#### Logistics

We need to talk to this team for travel reimbursements and day-of floor plans.

In travel reimbursements, we confirm the cost-per-mile constants per means of transport,
among other things.

We may call upon them to help with the day-of registration as well.

#### Day-of

We interact with day-of for two major things: judging and day-of registration.

We have the judging platform, so we must agree on the procedure (usually just 1 big
judging rounds with professors judging for everything).

#### VHX

The **V**olunteers and **H**acker e**X**perience team
helps us by providing the people on the day-of - much like any other team.

R&D does not require volunteers except at day-of registration. 5 or 6 do the trick then.

That said, we provide the mentoring platform and the app for VHX. They need documentation on
how to use these tools.

#### Food

SnackRU is deprecated, but we may be in touch regarding this: it was intended to track snack consumption.

The food team gives us a pdf of the menu to put on the website.

### WiCS

We used to help with HackHERS, but now they have their own static site.

They have a smaller team and we talk to them only to offer our tools.

## Times

It's important to have a schedule. Big things other teams do and related tips are included.
This is a count-down to the HackRU. Note that the summers, winters, and life, the universe,
and everything, may change the exact dates - these are approximate.

These timings are also based on past HackRUs: not on any real science, just experience.

- (HackRU - 3 months) MnD polls for a theme and finance starts saying "spon doc" (sponsorship document).
- (HackRU - 2.5 months) Spon-doc is roughly done. Look at it to get an idea of the colors
  and designs MnD is thinking of. (It's also good to know.)
- (HackRU - 2 months and 1 week) the design of the site should be known. Optimally, a demo
  of the registration site is live and being discussed.
- (HackRU - 2 months) registration opens. Optimally, travel reimbursement should be here.
- (HackRU - 1 month) food knows its vendors and has probably talked to them. Day-of has probably
  found judges. VHX is busy recruiting. Registration closes for hackers. Sponsorship should be close
  to finalized in most cases, so logos should be appearing on the site.
- (HackRU - 3 weeks) first wave of acceptances. We need to plan workshops. Most projects should be tested.
  VHX should have documentation on using the relevant HackRU apps by now.
- (HackRU - 2 weeks) second wave of acceptances. Workshops happen.
  Logistics definitely has finalized floor plans, so you should prod them about it.
- (HackRU - 1 day) :poop: :fire: Actually, it's usually chill since VHX does a great job with volunteers.
- (HackRU + 2 weeks) site can be taken down and DB dropped (but have a backup - sponsors might ask for aggregates).
  A splash site should be put up. There should be a link to the old devpost so that hackers can claim their prizes.

If HackHERS works off the same schedule, you'll notice that HackRU and HackHERS overlap. So should their preparation,
unfortunately.

### Day-of Timings

This is a rough HackRU schedule, also from experience. It's to explain what projects are used when so you know what
to expect on the floor of HackRU.

- 6 pm (or later) Friday: registration walkthrough for volunteers: make sure they know the flow.
- 10 am Saturday: registration: R&D does this. You'll be ready. QR scanning and the label printer are essential.
- 12 pm: Lunch means more QRs. The mentorship and team building apps may be demoed at opening.
- 6 pm: Dinner also leads to QRs.
- 12 am (Sunday): T-shirts, midnight surprise means QRs.
- 2 am: midnight meal means QRs.
- 8 am: breakfast means QRs.
- 9:30 am: judging walkthrough (so the juding app has to be up and ready)
- 10 am: Judging (or a bit later).

## Meetings

There are a plethora of meetings we go to.

### Project leads

This is just to catch up with the team and keep R&D on one page about the progress of everything.
The weekly-updates folder has all the details, but the main point is to have every project have a sort-of
stand-up: let them reveal their state, their blockers, and their todos.

Leave room for more specific questions too. Also, consider having project leads demo their projects occasionally,
to track progress and dive deeper into one project as needed.

### All of R&D

We hope you meet the architects. They ought to know you and you ought to know them. So meet! This should not be a very
serious meeting. Have fun with it.

### Directors

You should meet with the directors weekly to handle inter-team communication and updates. This is like a drawn-out stand-up
since blockers are resolved at times and the decisions involved might go back and forth a bit.

Nowadays, these meetings hardly last longer than an hour, so are just about efficient.

### Exec 1-on-1s

R&D should somewhat insist on this. The execs should have a good pulse on R&D and R&D is very active.
This is also useful so that deadlines can be better arranged and so that you don't burn yourself out.
It might just help to know that the authorities (FWIW) support you.

## Other Stuff we Do

Qasim and I have been busy outside of R&D too. But there are a few small things that we don't really know who should
continue to do, so I'm just writing it here.

The most tangible thing is the CS club presidents chat. We like that, as an R&D thing, it's very neutral, because
HackRU tends to be. This chat is a quick utility to let clubs talk to each other and share important information.
So anybody should say anything, really. So far we have the following:
- Fizzbuzz (interview prep)
- RUCP (competitive programming)
- WiCS (women in CS)
- IEEE (engineering society)
- RUSTEAM (STEAM society)
- HackRU exec directors
- USACS (general CS society)
- QFC (quantitative finance club)
- COGS (creation of games society)
- SWE (society of women engineers)

Please continue it.

We also promote hackathons, project-building, and inclusivity in programming.
The first two promotions are natural. It also becomes easier to invite architects as you get to know them
(so do that). Once people are at the hackathon, getting them to build a project is not that difficult either:
just talk to them about ideas and most people will at least attempt something.
Inclusivity is a lot harder to measure and be consistent with. But be nice and welcoming.

# Lessons we Learned

So this part is a bit philosophical. In fact, it's likely
Qasim would disagree with some of this. Or say it in a different way.
Or something.

## Say no.

This is an important lesson. Saying no is difficult. But do it. Otherwise R&D won't sustain.
So if a project simply can't make the deadline, just say no. If there's a feature that can't
be done in time, say no.

There is a balance between being under pressure to finish R&D tasks and being able to maintain
the sanity of the team.

## Bother people.

People don't do things unless you bother them. Just be a nag. Because that's your job.

## Test, clean up, and recuperate.

Literally. There's no time. So just do it when you can.

Technical debt is like a fungus: it grows if untreated.

## People don't want to understand unless pushed to. (Document.)

Nobody really wants to understand absolutely everything ever about HackRU or even R&D.
So you have to push people to understand.

And "understanding" is hard to understand. People can have the most messed up notions
of what something is and a lot of wrong answers can sound right. So it'd be hard for
you to know when people understand things. Keep asking them questions. Make them take
minor intuitive leaps.

Pushing may vary too. The best way to push people to understand is to document.
The more you write, the clearer you become. Not because your verbose, but because
you have practice. But sometimes, also because you've written out something
that counters a misconception. Like this paragraph: "the more you write, the clearer
you become" is really stupid thing to say - writers would probably scoff at it.
But then, there are two explanations: that you get experience (the less useful and
applicable explanation) and that you clear up misconceptions. By being meta (and
writing a lot), I hope I've established the later: that I've given you examples
of what I mean, so that you do really know what I mean to say.

So, document well and clearly. Define the concept,
discuss the idea, and then provide an example.

## Delegate.

Let your project leads lead their projects. Don't do everything.
You should be replaceable.

## This is your baby. Love it. Cherish it. But remember to let go.
