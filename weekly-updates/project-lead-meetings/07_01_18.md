# Project Lead Meeting July 1, 2018

* Project README's
 * We will be looking over READMEs and creating issues to make them more clear.
* Alumni Meetings
 * We are doing a meeting with Alumni Mentors right before the project leads meeting next week.
* Architects For Teams
 * Architect assignment will be done by Wednesday, July 11th
* HackRU Alumni Meetings
