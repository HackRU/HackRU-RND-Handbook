# Project Lead Meeting *07/15/18*

## Team Updates

* We have an allocation sheet - [on the drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SX0hXLaauSCtHQYmFvKXj-JvTxejarh3kWIdz5WWmFk/edit#gid=0).
* We have SnackRU, for once.
* After this, hopefully, you'll be able to fix your first meetings with architects and alumni.
* Please fill in last week's minutes if you haven't. We'd like to know what deadline you have
  in mind. (Feel free to just have 1 PR or whatever, just put in your deadline.)
* Today, we want to share some ideas on leading architects for your first meeting. Just because
  we've messed it up 2 or 3 times by now. There are some major goals:
  - make sure your architects know what they're doing.
  - make sure your architects know why they're doing it.
  - make sure your architects know what they need to know to do what they need to.

## Sub dividing projects: notes

You need to split up your projects to have architects work really well together.
This way, you also know what people are doing. Here are some ideas:
* divide issues and keep allocating them.
* If you have a design, see how that can be divided. (Min-cut, LOL.)
* *Suggested project division* (If you really need ideas of thinking how to divide your team think of it this way.  Then think of how you might want to divide it)
  * Frontend -> UI and interactions **outside** of the application
  * Backend -> Service and logic of the application **within the application**
  * QA testing -> Testing, enforcing proper practices, enforcing documentation. 

**Create a new branch, fill out this document for your project section, and create a pull request**
